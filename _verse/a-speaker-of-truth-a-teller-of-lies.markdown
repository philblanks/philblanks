Within a revelation hides a secret
Those who guide also distract
Those who heal also sicken

Even a mystery looks like a mystery
From a skewed angle, a twist looks like a fold
A bent out of shape worldview can still match a sensible spec

In a world driven by oversimplified points of view, some things are undeniably steered by other-scopic elements
Have I relayed this accurately, have I spoken truthfully?
Can you see my dark spots coming from my light?

When someone can use a piece of something they have to get a whole of what they want from another, what would make them leave it shelved or sheathed, unseen or unheard?
What would lead them to give a half to another who thought it was a whole?

If I can only survive through a lie, where does Truth end and Life begin?
If I can only thrive by living truth, what darkeness have you drawn from the well of light?
Is there light in darkness? Is there darkness in light?
Is truth alive in a world that constantly kills?
Is a lie like a death and a birth like a light; both parts of life?
Would I still look beautiful if I stopped wearing makeup?
Would I still be beautiful if I looked any different?

Does it still seem irrational to see makeup as a feature and to call a fiction untrue?
